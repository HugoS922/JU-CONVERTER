 this is the test for translate 

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ah-oh-oh-oh

And they come unstuck

Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I gotta lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
